# Skewbacca

by niorad for [DevLids.com](https://DevLids.com)

An electron-app to quickly un-skew laptop-lids from photos, and create a file which is ready for usage on DevLids.
Needs ImageMagick ("convert") to be available.
Only tested on OSX so far.

## Working

- Placing four points on each corner of a lid via drag & drop
- Generation and display of un-skewed image via ImageMagick

## ToDo

- Quicker generation of preview-image
- Drag image into window and dock-icon
- Remove boilerplate menu-entries
- Enable arrow-keys for handles
