An electron-app to quickly un-skew laptop-lids from photos, and create a file which is ready for usage on DevLids.
Needs ImageMagick ("convert") to be available.
Only tested on OSX so far.

## Features so far

- Placing four points on each corner of a lid via drag & drop (the red handle has to be placed on the upper left corner of the lid)
- Generation and display of un-skewed image via ImageMagick

## Getting started

- brew install imagemagick
- yarn && yarn start
